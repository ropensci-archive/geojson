Title: Highly Optimized Protocol Buffer Serializers
Author: Jeroen Ooms
Maintainer: Jeroen Ooms <jeroen@berkeley.edu>
Description: Pure C++ implementations for reading and writing several common data 
    formats based on Google protocol-buffers. Currently supports 'rexp.proto' for 
    serialized R objects, 'geobuf.proto' for binary geojson, and 'mvt.proto' for 
    vector tiles. This package uses the auto-generated C++ code by protobuf-compiler, 
    hence the entire serialization is optimized at compile time. The 'RProtoBuf' 
    package on the other hand uses the protobuf runtime library to provide a general-
    purpose toolkit for reading and writing arbitrary protocol-buffer data in R.
